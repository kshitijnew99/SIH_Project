# Problem #2 Fix: Total Area Not Showing in Dashboard

## Issue Description
The total area was not showing correctly in the landowner dashboard and view analytics page. The fields were showing as 0 or undefined values.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **field name mismatch** between:
- **Data Storage**: Land data was being saved with the field name `area` (in AddNewLand.tsx)
- **Data Access**: Dashboard and analytics pages were trying to access `land.landSize`

## Files Fixed
1. **LandownerDashboard.tsx** - Line 126 and Line 299
   - Changed `land.landSize` to `land.area`
   - Fixed total area calculation in profile overview
   - Fixed individual land area display

2. **ViewAnalytics.tsx** - Lines 70, 94, and 428
   - Changed `land.landSize` to `land.area`
   - Fixed total area calculation for analytics cards
   - Fixed monthly earnings calculation (depends on area)
   - Fixed land details overview display

## Code Changes Made

### LandownerDashboard.tsx
```tsx
// Before (broken):
{landListings.reduce((total, land) => total + parseFloat(land.landSize), 0)} acres

// After (fixed):
{landListings.reduce((total, land) => total + parseFloat(land.area || 0), 0)} acres
```

### ViewAnalytics.tsx
```tsx
// Before (broken):
const totalArea = landListings.reduce((sum, land) => sum + parseFloat(land.landSize || 0), 0);

// After (fixed):
const totalArea = landListings.reduce((sum, land) => sum + parseFloat(land.area || 0), 0);
```

## Data Structure Confirmed
The correct field structure for land data is:
```javascript
{
  id: Number,
  title: String,
  area: String,        // ✅ Correct field name (e.g., "5.5")
  location: String,
  status: String,      // 'available' or 'rented'
  fertilityIndex: String,
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Test confirmed calculation works correctly
- ✅ Expected: 18.75 acres (5.5 + 10.0 + 3.25)
- ✅ Actual: 18.75 acres  
- ✅ Both dashboard and analytics pages now show correct totals

## Impact Fixed
1. **Landowner Dashboard**: Total area now displays correctly in profile overview
2. **View Analytics**: 
   - Total Area card shows correct values
   - Monthly earnings calculations work properly
   - Land details overview displays individual areas correctly

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The total area is now correctly calculated and displayed in both the landowner dashboard and view analytics pages.
